*********************************************************** TASK TRACKER APP*******************************************************************
 Added 2 new components button and header.
 Added the header component in appcomponent.html
 Applied global styling for common elements in styles.css
 Using interpolation added title to the header component. Used button component in the header of header component. 
 Designed a button, styled it using [ngStyle] in button component html using component communication @Input and @Output which are set inside buttoncomponent.ts file and the attributes are given in headercomponent.html inside the app-button selector.
 In this way i can use the button component to have any text on it have any color to it and perform in different functions as and where required thus making it reusable.
 Used EventEmitter in button component.ts. and @Output to send the data ahead
 Event: (click) -> User Defined fn: onClick() -> calls event emitter defined inside it: this.btnClick.emit() -> Dont forget to define Even emitter using @Output and EventEmitter, Output import abvove
